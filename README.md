# Optimal-Array-Sorting-
This repository contains a C program that determines whether an array should be sorted in ascending or descending order based on the minimum number of swaps required. Using an optimized Bubble Sort algorithm with early exit detection, the program efficiently counts swaps and sorts the array in the order that requires fewer swaps.

Key Features:

Swap Counting: The program calculates the number of swaps for both ascending and descending sorts using the Bubble Sort technique.

Optimal Sorting: Based on the swap count, it chooses the order with the least number of swaps and sorts the array accordingly.

Bubble Sort Optimization: Uses early exit if the array is already sorted to improve performance.

User Input: The user can input an array of up to 1000 elements, and the program outputs the sorted array along with the number of swaps performed.

Efficiency: Handles moderate input sizes within a 1-second execution time limit.
